# Express Quickstart

1. Fuck pug. Tired of that shit. I'm switching to EJS to reduce friction.
2. Packages are up-to-date without having to run `npm audit fix --force`.
3. I can never remember the name "nodemon" when I need it.
4. This is configured so nodemon watches _all_ files.
5. A person shouldn't code passwords, so this quickstarter prompts for a password instead.
